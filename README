this is my research topic SOM(Spatial Outlier Mining)

this project mainly implements of

SLOM(Spatial Local Outlier Measure) and 

SLOF(Spatial Local Outlier Factor) 

algorithm. but i choose to use Delaunay Triangulation(DT) 

to get the neighbor relationship of each spatial object.

the test datasets is us2000 census saved in postgresql database.
